Feel free to email \textbf{yong.loh12@imperial.ac.uk} if you found any bugs!

\section{Setting Up The GUI}

Copy and paste the whole \emph{GUITesting} folder in any directory. Open up a terminal, and hover to the directory containing the folder by using the \textbf{cd} command (Using the \textbf{pwd} command you should see something like: /staff/yl13/GUITesting) and run the command:
\begin{center}
chmod 777 -R GUITest/
\end{center}
to make every file runnable.

\section{Running The GUI}

Run the GUI by double clicking the \emph{RUNME} and click Run. Alternatively, drag the \emph{RUNME} file to the top panel of any GNOME-classic interface(using the mouse) and this will create a shortcut at the top of the panel. Run the GUI by clicking the icon you just created and this will run the GUI.

\section{Known Problems When Running The GUI}
If \emph{RUNME} doesn't run at all, i.e. if nothing pops up after clicking Run, then please open terminal and type in the following command:
\begin{center}
java -version
\end{center}
If the output is:
\begin{center}
java version ``1.6.0\_27" 
\end{center}
or anything less than 1.7, the java version must be updated to version 1.7.
An easy way is to open terminal, type in:
\begin{center}
which java
\end{center}
which will locate the directory of java. Now go into the GUITesting/GUITest/jre1.7.0\_25/ and replace the java file with the newer version.

\section{Before Using the GUI}
\subsection{Suggested Input Format}
Since all 3 pipelines output files in the same directory as the input file, it is highly recommended(almost a must to prevent error) to use a seperate folder for each image files to process. An example would be instead of having all 4 images files in same directory, such as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item /staff/yl13/Testing/Data1.nii.gz
\item /staff/yl13/Testing/Data2.nii.gz
\item /staff/yl13/Testing/Data3.nii.gz
\item /staff/yl13/Testing/Data4.nii.gz
\end{enumerate}
It is highly recommended to change the above format to something like:
\begin{enumerate}
\item /staff/yl13/Testing/Data1/Data1.nii.gz
\item /staff/yl13/Testing/Data2/Data2.nii.gz
\item /staff/yl13/Testing/Data3/Data3.nii.gz
\item /staff/yl13/Testing/Data4/Data4.nii.gz
\end{enumerate}
in which all image files are in their individual unique folder, yet in the same parent folder, which is /staff/yl13/Testing. This will ease the process to locate all the image files and outputting the files to their correct folder. Extra input prerequisites is mentioned in the beginning of the following sections.

\section{The Main Frame}

If \emph{RUNME} successfully runs, you should be able to see a small frame appearing at top left corner specifying all 3 parts of pipeline mentioned earlier, which is \textbf{\textit{Diffusion Pre-processing}}, \textbf{\textit{T2 Pre-processing}}, \textbf{\textit{Cortical Analysis}} and a \textbf{\textit{Exit}} button. All 3 process uses a very similar interface with very minor changes, which all of them have both a \emph{Auto} and \emph{Manual} view.

\subsection{Diffusion Pre-processing}

As mentioned, there are two views for this process, which will be explained below.
\\*
\\
**Important Note: Every input must have at least one \textbf{\textit{*bvecs*}} or \textbf{\textit{*bval*}} present in the folder containing the image file, in which * means matches everything. For example:
\\*
\\
Input data to process is: /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU123/unreg-data.nii.gz.
\\
Please check that inside the folder /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU123/, it must contains both bvecs and bval.
\\*
\\
**Please check input data and ensure that volumes is equal to the number of bvec or bval entries, i.e. no trace image.

\subsubsection{Diffusion Pre-processing(Auto)}
By clicking Diffusion Pre-processing from the Main Frame, another frame which are titled as ``Diffusion Pre-processing(Auto)" would open up. In \emph{Auto} view, you just have to specify the parent folder. For example, if images to process are
\begin{enumerate}
\item /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU123/unreg-data.nii.gz
\item /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU456/unreg-data.nii.gz
\item /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU789/unreg-data.nii.gz
\item/staff/yl13/Testing/NNU1000/unreg-data.nii.gz
\end{enumerate}
Steps required are as follows:
\\*
\\
First specify /staff/yl13/Testing in input directory by using the \textbf{Open} Button. 
Next type unreg-data.nii.gz(The default is unreg-data.*) in the text field besides \textbf{File name to search(1)} and hit next. This will proceed to the Diffusion Pre-processing(Manual) frame with all inputs populated.
\\*
\\
**Note: You can add more files name to search by using the \textbf{Add more files to search} button, and note that * matches everything, e.g. unreg-data.* will work for the example above as well.
\\*
\\
Alternatively, you can also use the \textbf{Switch View to Manual} button to manually select the image files.

\subsubsection{Diffusion Pre-processing(Manual)}

In this view, you'll have to manually specify all image files by using the \textbf{Open} button. For example, if images to process are the same as above, steps required are as follows:
\\*
\\
First increase the number of datasets by dragging the \textbf{slider} besides the label \textbf{Number of datasets} to 4 and hit the \textbf{Go} button besides it. This will increase the available inputs to 4(instead of 1). 
Next specify the full path to the image files using the \textbf{Open} button. The final result should look like:
\begin{itemize}[label={}]
  \item Number of datasets : 4
  \item Input data 1: /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU123/unreg-data.nii.gz
  \item Input data 2: /staff/yl13/Testing/NNu456/unreg-data.nii.gz
  \item Input data 3: /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU789/unreg-data.nii.gz
  \item Input data 4: /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU1000/unreg-data.nii.gz
\end{itemize}
If you used the \textbf{Diffusion Pre-processing(Auto)} and followed the steps in the previous section, you should reach the same stage as using the manual up until this point. The next steps is to determine whether to run \textbf{bedpostx} and \textbf{eddy\_correct} by using the check box. Finally, to run the process, simply hit the \textbf{Go} button and the process should start. Additional buttons such as \textbf{Switch View to Auto} allows you to go back to the \emph{Auto} view, while the \textbf{Clear} button clears all entries typed in the inputs. Additionally, you can specify how many process to run in parallel by typing the number in the textfield besides the \textbf{Number of Concurrent Process} label.

\subsection{T2 Pre-processing}
There are also two views for this process, which will be explained below.
\subsubsection{T2 Pre-processing(Auto)}
The steps required here is very similar to the \textbf{\textit{Diffusion Pre-processing(Auto)}}, please refer to the section above for more details. Some noticeable changes are the additional \textbf{Age file}. Using any text editor(such as gedit), create a text file that contains the age at scan corresponding to the input files. For example, if the images to process are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU123/NNU123\_T2.nii.gz
	\item /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU456/NNU456\_T2.nii.gz
	\item /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU789/NNU789\_T2.nii.gz
	\item /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU1000/NNU1000\_T2.nii.gz
\end{enumerate}
simply create a text file that looks like this:
\begin{itemize}[label={}]
	\item 28
	\item 33
	\item 40
	\item 44
\end{itemize}
in which the subject NNU123 is scanned at age 28, etc. The format is type in 28 and hit \emph{Enter} and continue with 33, and hit \emph{Enter}, etc. The order of the age should match the same way as how the system sort the files. After saving the file, back in the GUI, specify the full path to the age file using the \textbf{Open} button besides it.
\\*
\\
**Important Note: Age text file can be left blank and it will populate all inputs to age of 36(by default), in which you can still manually change it in the \emph{Manual} view after hitting the \textbf{Next} button.

\subsubsection{T2 Pre-processing(Manual)}

This view will be of a very familiar sight if you used \textbf{\textit{Diffusion Pre-processing(Manual)}}, with an exception of an extra field for each input, which is the \textbf{Age at scan(weeks)}. Simply refer to the \textbf{\textit{Diffusion Pre-processing(Manual)}} section for more details.

\subsection{Cortical Analysis}

This pipeline uses the exact same interface as \textbf{\textit{T2 Pre-processing}} but runs a different process. In the \emph{Manual} view, you will need to specify a \textbf{Template\_age} as well. 
\\*
\\
For this pipeline, there is a few important input prerequisites that must be followed:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{\textit{T2 Pre-processing}} must be done beforehand with all the outputs in the same folder as the input.
    \item If \textbf{Diffusion Space} is checked, \textbf{\textit{Diffusion Pre-processing}} is expected to be finished and the ouput must be inside the same folder as the input as well.
\end{enumerate}
An example would be:
\\*
Input data 1: /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU123/filename.nii.gz. 
\\*
So in the folder /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU123, it should contains(assuming \textbf{Diffusion Space} is checked):
\begin{enumerate}
	\item /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU123/segmentations, which contains all 3 expected output after running segmentation, and other files outputted from \textbf{\textit{T2 Pre-Processing}}.
    \item /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU123/dti\_FA.nii.gz, other dti files,
    \\*
    /staff/yl13/Testing/NNU123/nodif\_brain.nii.gz, and other files outputted from \textbf{\textit{Diffusion Pre-processing}}
\end{enumerate}
