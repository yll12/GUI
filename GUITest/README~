if RUNME doesn't run at all, please open terminal and type in the following command:

java -version

if output is:

java version "1.6.0_27" or anything less than 1.7, the java version must be updated to
version 1.7.

An easy way is to open terminal, type in:

which java

which will locate the directory of java. Now go into the GUITesting/GUITest/jre1.7.0_25/ and
copy the whole bin folder and replace the bin folder shown in the terminal, and it should work fine!
